 * Global app state.
 *
 * `viewMode` drives the camera rig and room lighting:
 *   'desktop' — full view of the room, orbit controls enabled
 *   'gallery' — the My Pictures window is open, camera eases toward the screen
 *   'photo'   — a photo is open fullscreen, camera zooms in close and the
 *               room outside the CRT frame dims
 *
 * `cursor` is intentionally a mutable object (not React state) — it is written
 * on every pointer move and read inside useFrame loops, so routing it through
 * setState would re-render the whole screen scene at pointer frequency.
